## Uncommon terminology common in Probabilistic Programming

- Stochastic: used to describe processes, systems, or variables that are inherently random or probabilistic in nature. In contrast to deterministic processes, where outcomes are precisely determined by initial conditions, stochastic processes involve some level of unpredictability and randomness

- Stochastic vs. Deterministic: In deterministic models, the outcome is fully determined by the initial conditions and the system's rules. In stochastic models, even with known initial conditions and rules, the outcome is not certain and can vary due to random influences.
