# Probabilistic Python

### Probabilistic programming

Probabilistic programming is a paradigm that combines the techniques of probability theory with programming to create models that can reason and make decisions under uncertainty. This approach allows developers to build complex statistical models that can represent uncertain situations and make inferences from data. This repository aims to introduce probabilistic programming using Bayesian Modeling with PyMC.

## Bayesian Modeling with PyMC

Bayes' theorem provides the mathematical framework for updating beliefs

$$
P(\theta \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)}
$$
